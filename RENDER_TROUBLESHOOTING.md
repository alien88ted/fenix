# Render Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "Deploy status 1" with no build logs

This error typically occurs due to configuration issues. Here's how to fix it:

### Root Causes and Solutions

#### 1. Package Manager Conflicts ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Mixed usage of `npm` and `pnpm` in configuration files.
**Solution**: 
- Removed incomplete `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Updated `render.yaml` to use `npm ci` instead of `pnpm`
- Updated `scripts/build.sh` to use `npm ci`
- Ensured `package-lock.json` is committed to repository

#### 2. Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: Required environment variables not set in Render dashboard.
**Solution**: Set these required variables in Render dashboard:
```
DATABASE_URL=<your-postgresql-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=<your-privy-app-id>
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=<your-privy-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
```

#### 3. Node Version Compatibility
**Problem**: Node version mismatch between local and Render.
**Current Configuration**: Node 20.18.1 (specified in render.yaml)
**Solution**: Already configured correctly in `render.yaml`

#### 4. Build Command Issues
**Fixed Configuration**:
```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci && npx prisma generate && npm run build
startCommand: npm start
```

## Quick Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Render, ensure:

- [ ] ✅ `package-lock.json` is committed (NOT `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- [ ] ✅ `render.yaml` uses `npm` commands
- [ ] All required environment variables are set in Render dashboard
- [ ] Database URL points to a PostgreSQL database (not SQLite)
- [ ] Privy credentials are valid and match your app configuration

## How to Deploy

1. **Push changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Render Dashboard**:
   - Go to your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" > "Clear build cache and deploy"
   - Monitor the build logs

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - Visit: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Should return JSON with health status

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Cannot find module"
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Clear build cache in Render dashboard
- Redeploy

### "Database connection failed"
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Ensure database accepts connections from Render
- Check if using correct PostgreSQL URL format

### "Privy authentication error"
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID starts with 'clj' or 'cmg'
- Ensure PRIVY_APP_SECRET is set
- Check Privy dashboard for correct credentials

### Build timeout (15 minutes)
- Consider upgrading Render plan
- Optimize build by removing unnecessary dependencies
- Use build caching effectively

## Build Script Details

The corrected build process:
1. `npm ci` - Install dependencies from lock file
2. `npx prisma generate` - Generate Prisma client
3. `npm run build` - Build Next.js application
4. `npm start` - Start production server

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test the production build locally:

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
npm ci

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Build application
npm run build

# Test production build
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to verify everything works.

## Summary of Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Removed conflicting `pnpm-lock.yaml`
2. ✅ Updated `render.yaml` to use `npm` commands
3. ✅ Updated `scripts/build.sh` to use `npm ci`
4. ✅ Created `.env.example` for environment variables reference
5. ✅ Verified build works locally with `npm run build`

The deployment should now work correctly on Render. Make sure to commit these changes and push to your repository, then trigger a new deployment with "Clear build cache" option enabled.
